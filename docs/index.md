A quick run-down about me:

 I’m a proud Pythonista specializing in high-performance backend web services. Python 3, asyncio, and typing are my jam.

 I’m a science-fiction writer, currently working on a space opera set in a future where data is the only currency.

 I’m a lover of Shakespeare and classical text, and run a private group that gets together weekly all over NYC to read his works together.
